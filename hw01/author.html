          <h2> Joseph Martin Kronheim </h2>

          <p>Joseph Martin Kronheim was a German lithographer and wood engraver who illustrated children's picture books including My First Picture Book, Printed in colours by Kronheim (1875). He advanced a printing process using zinc instead of wood blocks, which reduced printing time. Kronheim & Co. printed hundreds of biblical prints and book illustrations, more than 5,000 total by the 1860s. His works are featured in our Favorite Fairy Tales
