            <h3> The Little Pig who Went to Market.</h3>

            <p>

There was once a family of Five Little Pigs, and Mrs. Pig, their mother, loved them all very dearly.
<br/>
Some of these little pigs were very good, and took a great deal of trouble to please her.
<br/>
The eldest pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr. Pig. One day he went to market with his cart full of vegetables,
<br/>
but Rusty, the donkey, began to show his bad temper before he had gone very far on the road.
<br/>
All the coaxing and whipping would not make him move. So Mr. Pig took him out of the shafts,
<br/>
and being very strong, drew the cart to market himself. When he got there, all the other pigs began to laugh.
<br/>
But they did not laugh so loudly when Mr. Pig told them all his struggles on the road. Mr.
<br/>
Pig lost no time in selling his vegetables, and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the market-place,
<br/>
and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the cart, Mr. Pig started for home without delay.
<br/>
When he got there, he told Mrs. Pig his story, and she called him her best and most worthy son.

          <h3>The Little Pig who Stayed at Home.</h3>

              <p>
                This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother, but as he was so mischievous that he could not
                <br/>
                be trusted far away, his mother made him stay at home, and told him to keep a good fire while she went
                <br/>
                out to the miller's to buy some flour. But as soon as he was alone, instead of learning his lessons,
                <br/>
                he began to tease the poor cat. Then he got the bellows, and cut the leather with a knife, so as to
                <br/>
                see where the wind came from: and when he could not find this out, he began to cry. After this he broke
                <br/>
                all his brother's toys; he forced the drum-stick through the drum, he tore off the tail from the kite,
                <br/>
                and then pulled off the horse's head. And then he went to the cupboard and ate the jam. When Mrs.
                <br/>
                Pig came home, she sat down by the fire, and being very tired, she soon fell asleep. No sooner had she done so,
                <br/>
                than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and tied her in her chair. But soon she awoke and found out all
                <br/>
                the mischief that he had been doing. She saw at once the damage that he had done to his brother's playthings.
                <br/>
                So she quickly brought out her thickest and heaviest birch, and gave this naughty little pig such a beating as he did
                <br/>
                not forget for a long time.

              <h3>The Little Pig who had Roast Beef.</h3>

                <p>
                This little pig was a very good and careful fellow. He gave his mother scarcely any trouble, and always took a pleasure
                <br/>
                in doing all she bade him. Here you see him sitting down with clean hands and face, to some nice roast beef, while his
                <br/>
                brother, the idle pig, who is standing on a stool in the corner, with the dunce's cap on, has none. He sat down and quietly
                <br/>
                learned his lesson, and asked his mother to hear him repeat it. And this he did so well that Mrs. Pig stroked him on the ears
                <br/>
                and forehead, and called him a good little pig. After this he asked her to allow him to help her make tea. He brought everything
                <br/>
                she wanted, and lifted off the kettle from the fire, without spilling a drop either on his toes or the carpet. By-and-bye he went
                <br/>
                out, after asking his mother's leave, to play with his hoop. He had not gone far when he saw an old blind pig, who, with his hat
                <br/>
                in his hand was crying at the loss of his dog; so he put his hand in his pocket and found a halfpenny which he gave to
                <br/>
                the poor old pig. It was for such thoughtful conduct as this that his mother often gave this little pig roast beef.
                <br/>
                We now come to the little pig who had none.
                <br/>

                <h3> The Little Pig who had None. </h3>

                  <p> This was a most obstinate and willful little pig. His mother had set him to learn his lesson, but no sooner had
                    <br/>
                    she gone out into the garden, than he tore his book into pieces. When his mother came back

                    he ran off into the streets
                    <br/>
                    to play with other idle little pigs like himself. After this he quarrelled with one of the pigs and got a sound


                    <br/>
                    thrashing. Being afraid to go home, he stayed out till it was quite dark and caught a severe cold. So he was



                    <br/>

                    taken home and put to bed, and had to take a lot of nasty physic.

                    <hr> The Little PIG who cried wee, wee, all the way home. </h3>
                    

                      <p>
                        This little pig went fishing. Now he had been told not to go into Farmer Grumpey's grounds, who did not allow
                        <br/>
                        any one to fish in his part of the river. But in spite of what he had been told, this foolish little pig
                        <br/>
                        went there. He soon caught a very large fish, and while he was trying to carry it home, Farmer Grumpey
                        <br/>
                        came running along with his great whip. He quickly dropped the fish, but the farmer caught him, and as
                        <br/>
                        he laid his whip over his back for some time, the little pig ran off, crying, “Wee, wee, wee,” all the way home.
